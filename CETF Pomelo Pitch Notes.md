# CETF Pomelo Pitch Notes





Here are some thoughts how we might be able to improve the description. 

I’m trying something new and posting my thoughts in a GitHub markdown file. I think this might be a very helpful workflow to reduce cluttering the telegram chat, organize better, and experiment with some great GitHub features such as commenting, version control, forking, issues and pull requests. 

Note that I haven’t had much time to refine or deeply reflect on everything I wrote here, so there might be some bad ideas or improvement needed, but I think that there are some good ideas that are worth exploring (and I figure that Github may enable a more iterative and collaborative process).

Feel free to ignore or share any comments on Github, Telegram, or however else 🙂

This statement isn’t really true.

You don’t need to answer the third question to invest in EOS based tokens. 

Sometimes it’s best to just invest and figure out when to sell sometime later. Sometimes it’s best to hold tokens indefinitely 🙂

I feel the the phrase ‘that within itself contains’ is kind of abstract and it would be helpful to simplify this. For example:

“What if you could just buy one token that contains many other tokens? 

What if you could buy an entire fund of the best EOS tokens with just one token?”

 

<br/>
<br/>

The second sentence here sounds kind of rough. I think it would help to avoid ending the sentence with ‘instead of you.’ Instead, it may be helpful to focus on how it can make it ‘easier for you’.  I feel like a more complete sentence would help here too.

For example: ‘Tokens in the fund are bought and sold by professional fund managers so you can be confident in your investments and focus on doing what you love’.

Something like that.


<br/>
<br/>


I feel like it might also be helpful to reiterate the word ‘fund’ here, rather than repeating the word ‘token’ with qualifiers.

Instead of something like:

“What if you could just buy one token that contains many other tokens?”

Maybe it would be best like:

“What if you could just buy one token that contains many other tokens? Introducing… the Fund Token! Tokens in the fund are bought and sold by professional fund managers so you can be confident in your investments and focus on doing what you love!”


<br/>
<br/>


That’s probably not the best way to say it but something like that might be helpful to simplify some of these sentences and provide a simple term for CETF assets.

On a related sidenote, I’ve always felt like the term Exchange Traded Fund is kind of abstract and difficult to understand. I’m not sure why the word ‘exchange’ needs to be there and the word ‘traded’ also seems unnecessary and uses a strange non-personal tense. 

I think the name CETF sounds great, but maybe calling the tokens more colloquially as Fund Tokens rather than ETFs might be helpful to simplify the value proposition for many people.

‘Within itself’ sounds a bit wordy, abstract, and confusing. “Such token” is also a bit abstract, though maybe I’m overthinking these - such token and within itself so have kind of a cool mystical sound/appeal to them, like a kind of poetic prose. 

Maybe better to write this like: 

“We have created this kind of fund token, called EOSETF, which contains 13 EOS mainnet tokens.”


<br/>
<br/>


Maybe it’s also better to focus more on the investor instead of the product. For example, this sentence could say something like:

 “We have created a token called EOSETF where you can easily invest in 13 EOS mainnet tokens!”



<br/>
<br/>

I would end this sentence on a more positive and exciting note. Not getting rekt is great lol, but I think it’s helpful to end the paragraph with more optimism and excitement.

Maybe it would be helpful to add an additional sentence about how fund managers who closely follow the EOS ecosystem can make the most of subtle market trends to maximize returns and create as much value as possible for investors. Something like that.



<br/>
<br/>

It might be clearer to rephrase these sentences to something like this: 

Since traders are naturally incentivized to arbitrage when prices deviate, the price of EOSETF is essentially pegged to the prices of the underlying assets in the fund.



<br/>
<br/>



![](CETF%20Pomelo%20Pitch%20Notes/49659020-4C23-45A3-9975-EB5065ABC125.png)

I would put some explanation points here because these are awesome and deserve to be emphasized more, though I understand if you prefer to be more understated.

<br/>



![](CETF%20Pomelo%20Pitch%20Notes/6B2C9F1B-3B5A-4391-AAC4-A19B836BE2E6.png)

This phrasing is kind of confusing. I would use a full sentence here. Like “We will use funding for….” or “Here is a list of our top priorities where we plan to use funding:”


<br/>
<br/>




Hope that helps.

At some point it might be helpful to copy/paste the entire pitch onto a new markdown file on GitHub and propose edits there, but I figured this was a good start for now.
